I recently set up this personal web site with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The default setup with `minima` theme is simple and easy, but I wanted to have a cool theme from http://jekyllthemes.org. The [jekyll-dash] theme looked good, so I tried to set it up, but hit few issues. In this post, I will share what were the issues and how I resolved them.

# Setup `jekyll-dash` theme

`remote-theme`

`_config.yml`

# Fixing `no posts` issue

`index.markdown` -> `index.html`
